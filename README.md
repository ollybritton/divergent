# Divergent, written by a computer.

I "trained" my computer to rewrite divergent. It kinda worked.

## Things it does that are funny

- Create it's own random chapters. The chapters will be something like `1,2,3,4,5,34,6,7,8` for whatever reason.

- Express its true love for fractions. It will literally stop in the middle of a moment just to write something like `456/56.`

- Says `"I don't know"` lots.

 ## Just for funsies:

 Given 500 letters to describe the meaning of life, it will write this:

support to me. I should have been anything to do it.

while and someone who were all the city. It’s not a

comes to them.”

Beautiful.

Also, let's do the same thing but crank up the complexity (however it makes more random words) and start with `"Olly is awesome because"`:

>Olly is awesome because he produces
the initiate voice, and he was only one of them,
because he's actually above me. It’s important to get in that way, he was sweet or
fail in the explosion for my
mouth to get into the building, which is
just before you?”

>“I’m not sure why you join you all in
the side,” he says.

>“None of the simulation serum, **there’s a genetic chicken**.
**Pepper breath.**”

>“Okay.” His eyes peel over both children. One of them. **I can’t even.**

Well there you go everybody.

Keep in mind what you just read was completely generated by a computer. I didn't teach it about

- Grammar
- Spelling
- What it was about
- How to use speech marks.

It learnt those things. It's just one step closer to taking over the world.

>The aliens are... still spreads to climb.
>
>I slip and my gun is relief, and my neck *inderstortly*, my
face stands.

It also likes to create it's own words, such as *inderstortly* from above.

I also did another version where I trained it with 50 lines of Eminem:

>[Eminem]
>Tired of hearing a stand of my spot
><br>
>*- PROFANITY -*
><br>
>*- PROFANITY -*
><br>
>You can see me on my hands and knees miss and store the stuck
*- PROFANITY -*
Turser to be shoulded to be all of my cars

So there you go.
